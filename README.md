### Project contribution
1. Pick one of the contribution tasks listed below
    - **Review Firefox Preview** 
      
        We are curious to learn how you approach a design problem and would encourage you to review the app with an critical eye and
        - name the three biggest issues you see in the app,
        - explain why it’s an issue and
        - show us how you would improve it

    - **Show us your past work** 
        
        We are curious to learn more about your past work, feel free to share a portfolio or any relevant links or docs. 

    - **Contribute to design issues** 
        
        Have a look at the [Firefox Preview GitHub board](https://github.com/orgs/mozilla-mobile/projects/28) and explore possible design solutions for issues listed there. Please don’t answer on the issues directly but open up a new issue in this repository and reference the one you are working on.

2. To document your designs, open a GitHub issue in this repository. Please make sure you explain what led to your design decisions. You can write text that explains your design, upload sketches or mocks. Learn about [supported file formats and sizes](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests).

3. To record your contribution, link your GitHub issue on the Outreachy platform 

4. Optional: Repeat if you want to. It’s important to us to see how you work and how you approach a design problem. This can be done in one issue or in multiple – it’s up to you.
